# Problem Statement
* To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies breast cancer tumors into malignant or benign categories using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

# Objective
* Train an SVM classifier for breast cancer prediction
* Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics
* Analyze model performance using ROC curve and ROC–AUC score

#  Dataset
* Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (scikit-learn)
* Samples: 569
* Features: 30 numerical diagnostic features
* Target Classes:
* 0 → Malignant
* 1 → Benign
* Missing Values: None

# Algorithm Used
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Kernel: Linear

# Results
* SVM achieved high accuracy in classifying tumors
* Confusion matrix shows correct and incorrect predictions
* Classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score
* ROC curve and ROC–AUC score confirm strong class separation

# Visualization
* ROC Curve: Shows the trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate
* ROC–AUC Score: Measures overall classification performance

 # Conclusion
* The SVM model effectively classifies breast cancer tumors with high accuracy and demonstrates strong performance through ROC–AUC analysis.
